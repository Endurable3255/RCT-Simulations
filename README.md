# RCT-Simulation-v1

In this repository, I will provide base R code for simulations of randomized controlled trials.  

I will begin with fairly straightforward examples and over time may begin adding more sophisticated ones as time and interest allows.  I am writing the code for the first few posts to minimize the need for advanced R knowledge (only installing packages if absolutely needed) in an effort to minimize hurdles for newer R users, and I'm annotating code as much as practical, but some basic knowledge of R (as well as general knowledge of RCT's and commonly performed statistical analyses) will facilitate your efforts to use the code stored here.

1. RCT_Parallel_Binary_Outcome provides template code to simulate a two-group parallel-arm randomized trial with a binary outcome.
2. (planned) RCT_Parallel_Time_To_Event_Outcome
3. (planned) RCT_Parallel_Binary_Outcome_With_Interim_Efficacy
4. (planned) RCT_Parallel_Time_To_Event_Outcome_With_Interim_Efficacy

More instructions will follow.
