# RCT-Simulation-v1

In this repository, I will store R code for simulations of randomized controlled trials.  I will begin with fairly straightforward examples and progressively add more sophisticated ones as time and interest allow.

1. RCT_Parallel_Binary_Outcome provides template code to simulate a two-group parallel-arm randomized trial with a binary outcome.

More instructions will follow.
