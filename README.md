# RCT Simulations

In this repository, I will provide base R scripts for simulations of randomized controlled trials.  

I will begin with fairly straightforward examples, though over time these posts may expand to more sophisticated code as time and interest allows.  At least for now, I'm trying to minimize the need for advanced R knowledge (only installing packages if absolutely needed) to minimize hurdles for newer R users, and I'm annotating code as much as practical, but some basic knowledge of R (as well as general knowledge of RCT's and commonly performed statistical analyses) will facilitate your efforts to use the code stored here.

4/2022 note: I plan to come back and overhaul this in a few months with a little more coherent, organized structure and better annotation.  I'm leaving some of what's here but a few of these are still works in progress.
